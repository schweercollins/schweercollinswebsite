	abstract = {Contextual therapy posits that a truly comprehensive grasp of human existence is composed of individual and relational realities. The Relational Ethics Scale (RES) is the only validated instrument to measure relational ethics, one of the relational realities’ four dimensions, which was theorized by Boszormenyi-Nagy. The RES measures people’s perception about constructs of loyalty, entitlement, trust and justice in their family of origin and in their current and significant relationships. Relational ethics has been shown to have implications for mature development, psychological health and family functioning. The aim of this research was to adapt the RES for use with Spaniards residing in Spain (N = 1181). Psychometric properties were analyzed, and construct validity was assessed using the Spanish-Differentiation Self Inventory. Results obtained indicate the Spanish Relational Ethics Scale (S-RES) is a valid and reliable tool for relational ethics assessment in Spanish populations. Couple and family counselors in Spain may consider the clinical assessment of relational ethics using the S-RES in order to explore issues of fairness, trust, roles, and re-balance when working to support complex family systems. Future research directions using the newly validated S-RES are discussed.},

	abstract = {Background: To examine the associations between adolescent pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes on substance use and suicide attempts in a sample who is at greater risk for substance use and suicide attempts — those who have been involved with the juvenile justice and child welfare systems.
Methods: Using a prospective, longitudinal design, we examined the role of adolescent pregnancy outcomes on risk for suicide attempts and substance use among a sample of 166 female adolescents with juvenile justice system and child welfare involvement.
Results: Of participants, 36\% (n = 60) reported at least one adolescent pregnancy with a total of 109 pregnancies reported. Adolescent pregnancy was associated with an increase in later suicide attempts (aOR = 1.68, 95\% CI 1.06–2.72). Miscarriage was associated with a 2-fold increase in the likelihood of later suicide attempts, (aOR = 2.12, 95\% CI 1.10–4.12). No participants who reported induced abortion (n = 13) reported suicide attempts. Adolescent pregnancy, miscarriage, and abortion were not significantly associated with later substance use (Ps {\textgreater} 0.05).
Conclusions: Healthcare professionals should conduct routine screening for suicidality in the months following a miscarriage, offer education to caregivers about how to support youth who experience pregnancy loss, provide additional social supports and familiarize themselves with local and virtual behavioral health resources to prevent suicide attempts among female adolescents who are at high risk and experience miscarriage.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to gain a clearer understanding of the relation between parental relationship qualities and overall emerging adulthood (EA) marijuana use processes. The present study drew from an ethnically and socioeconomially diverse sample of EAs (ages 19–22) and their parents (n = 470) from the Paciﬁc Northwest region. This study used parent-report and child-report data to capture measures of parenting and EA marijuana use outcomes. Latent Class Growth Analysis (LCGA) was used to model trajectories of marijuana use and risk factor analyses were used to examine how marijuana group membership varied by covariates and parental relationship qualities. Results revealed that lower levels of family cohesion and quality of parent–child communication were more likely to predict membership in the high-using groups and moderate-decreasing user groups in comparison to low-to-non users. Results also indicated that lower levels of frequency of parent–child communication were more likely to predict membership in the high-users group compared to the low-to-non users. Regarding parent knowledge of marijuana use, trends toward congruence and underestimation of EA marijuana use predicted membership in the high-using and moderate-decreasing groups compared to the low-to-non users. Study results indicate EAs in their early 20s may be more likely to engage in healthy decision-making regarding marijuana use in an environment that includes warm, supportive parent–child relationships where parents are aware of their EAs use without focusing on their EA’s perceptions of risk.},

Individuals scoring high on both Calvinist theological beliefs and complementarian gender role beliefs scored significantly higher on hierarchical relationship expectations and existential defensiveness, and preferred a Christian psychology view of integration and a male headship perspective of leadership, compared to those scoring low on Calvinism and complementarianism. In contrast, individuals scoring low on both theological dimensions scored higher on Arminianism, gender egalitarianism, social justice commitment, intercultural competence commitment, religious exploration, and they preferred an integration view of psychology and theology and a “no restrictions” perspective on women's roles.

	abstract = {Objectives  Given recent advances toward universal screening for Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs), our objective was to investigate whether children with higher ACEs experience poorer quality of provider care and greater challenges accessing needed mental health treatment.
Methods  This study uses a nationally representative sample of US children aged 0–17 years drawn from the National Survey on Children’s Health for 2016–2019. Caregivers and parents completed surveys between June 2016 and February 2020 (N = 131,774). Logistic regression models adjusting for identified covariates were used to test associations between a child’s number of ACEs, their quality of provider care, and their access to mental health treatment. All analyses used appropriate survey weighting commands.
Results  High ACEs (4 or more) were associated with lower quality of provider care, including effective care coordination [OR 0.45, 95\% CI (0.38, 0.52)], family-centered care [OR 0.49, 95\% CI (0.41, 0.58)], shared decision making [OR 0.50, 95\% CI (0.39, 0.85)], and referrals for care [OR 0.58, 95\% CI (0.43, 0.80)]; children with high ACEs were also less likely to have a medical home [OR 0.66, 95\% CI (0.57, 0.76)]. High ACEs were also significantly associated with greater difficulty accessing mental health treatment [OR 0.55, 95\% CI (0.43, 0.70)]. Similar results were found for children in the moderate ACE (2–3) and low ACE (1) groups.
Conclusions for Practice  Findings indicate that greater ACEs were associated with poorer quality medical care and greater difficulty accessing needed mental health treatment. Because findings indicate that children with high ACEs may be the least likely to receive quality care or necessary mental health treatment to address this adversity, universal screening for ACEs should be considered with caution.},

Although intervention studies have shown positive effects of interventions that target delinquent peer affiliation on reductions in delinquency among adolescents with juvenile justice histories, the success of such interventions for younger girls in foster care, without prior involvement with juvenile justice, is unknown. We analyzed data from a randomized clinical trial of the middle school version of the Keep Safe intervention in a sample of girls in foster care (n ¼ 100). The intervention was delivered to girls and foster parents during the transition to middle school. Path analysis suggested a significant intervention effect on reduction in affiliation with delinquent peers at 12 months (B ¼ À.21). No significant mediation effects were identified. The middle school Keep Safe intervention shows promise as a preventative intervention for reducing affiliation with delinquent peers, which importantly is associated with adolescent delinquent behavior.

Descriptive data regarding studies on the measurement of DoS and in the area of psychotherapy were also compiled. Results revealed that there is ample support for DoS as a predictor of psychological health and marital quality, and that there are positive associations between DoS and better physical health and intergenerational relationships. Results of this review show that there continue to be underexplored hypotheses and a paucity of longitudinal or causal research designs to test the stability of DoS, the intergenerational transmission of DoS, and the efficacy of clinical interventions in modifying DoS to promote optimal well-being.

	abstract = {Child neglect is the most prevalent form of child maltreatment (CM) in the U.S. and is consistently associated with negative outcomes for children. Although some research suggests that differences in parenting exist across the spectrum of maltreatment severity, little is known about whether and how severity of neglect relates to observed parenting quality. The present study tested whether mothers who engage in documented, higher severity neglect of their children would display less warm, affiliative parenting, and more harsh, controlling parenting while interacting with their preschool child, than less severely neglectful mothers, and non-CM mothers. A sample of 121 mother-preschooler dyads [low severity neglect (n = 29), high severity neglect (n = 40), and non-CM (n = 52)] participated, and parenting behaviors were coded during a joint laboratory challenge task. This study explored associations between severity of child neglect perpetration through coding of child protective services case records; and quality of observed parenting, using observational, micro-social coding of parenting behaviors. Regression analyses showed that high severity neglecting mothers displayed significantly less warm, affiliative parenting than lower severity neglecting and non-CM mothers, and more harsh, controlling parenting relative to their non-CM peers. Further, there were no differences between low severity neglect and non-CM mothers in the amount of warm, affiliative parenting observed. These findings advance our understanding of child neglect by revealing important differences in quality of observed parenting across the spectrum of neglect severity. Implications for conceptualizing child neglect and targeted intervention strategies are discussed.},

	abstract = {Introduction: In the field of adolescent development, meta-analysis offers valuable tools for synthesizing and assessing cumulative research evidence on the effectiveness of programs, practices, and policies intended to promote healthy adolescent development. When examining the impact of a program implemented across multiple primary studies, variation is often observed in the methodological attributes of those primary studies, such as their implementation methods, program components, participant characteristics, outcome measurement, and the systems in which programs are deployed. Differences in methodological attributes of primary studies represented in a meta-analysis, referred to as complexity, can yield variation in true effects across primary studies, which is described as heterogeneity.
Methods: We discuss heterogeneity as a parameter of interest in meta-analysis, introducing and demonstrating both graphical and statistical methods for evaluating the magnitude and impact of heterogeneity. We discuss approaches for presenting characteristics of heterogeneity in metaanalytic findings, and methods for identifying and statistically controlling for aspects of methodological complexity that may contribute to variation in effects across primary studies.
Results: Topics and methods related to assessing and explaining heterogeneity were contextualized in the field of adolescent development using a sample of primary studies from a large meta-analysis examining the effectiveness of brief alcohol interventions for youth. We highlighted approaches currently underutilized in the field and provided R code for key methods to broaden their use.
Conclusions: By discussing various heterogeneity statistics, visualizations, and explanatory methods, this article provides the applied developmental researcher a foundational understanding of complexity and heterogeneity in meta-analysis.},

	abstract = {Purpose  One in fourteen children in the United States experiences the incarceration of a parent with whom they have lived. Although prior research has established that witnessing the arrest of a parent is a common occurrence for children of criminal justice-involved parents, child outcomes following such an event are understudied. Little is known about the long-term impacts of witnessing an arrest on children and the extent to which they may vary by child age.
Methods  Using longitudinal data from the Parent Child Study of mothers and fathers incarcerated in state prison, we examine the witnessing of parental arrest as an acute traumatic event and identify the extent to which this type of trauma predicts externalizing and internalizing symptoms for children during their parents’ incarceration and following release.
Results  Witnessing a parent’s arrest predicted greater internalizing behavior concerns while parents were incarcerated, with a greater magnitude of effect for children under eight years of age. Six months post-release of the parent, children younger than age eight who witnessed the arrest showed significantly higher internalizing and externalizing behaviors. No effect was found for children ages eight years or older.
Conclusion  Implications for future policies to reduce the likelihood of children witnessing parental arrests, as well as the potential benefit of screening for trauma when working with children with incarcerated parents, are discussed.},
