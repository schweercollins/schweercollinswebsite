abstract: 
*Objectives* Given recent advances toward universal screening for Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs), our objective
was to investigate whether children with higher ACEs experience poorer quality of provider care and greater challenges
accessing needed mental health treatment.
*Methods* This study uses a nationally representative sample of US children aged 0–17 years drawn from the National Survey
on Children’s Health for 2016–2019. Caregivers and parents completed surveys between June 2016 and February 2020
(N = 131,774). Logistic regression models adjusting for identified covariates were used to test associations between a child’s
number of ACEs, their quality of provider care, and their access to mental health treatment. All analyses used appropriate
survey weighting commands.
*Results* High ACEs (4 or more) were associated with lower quality of provider care, including effective care coordination
[OR 0.45, 95% CI (0.38, 0.52)], family-centered care [OR 0.49, 95% CI (0.41, 0.58)], shared decision making [OR 0.50,
95% CI (0.39, 0.85)], and referrals for care [OR 0.58, 95% CI (0.43, 0.80)]; children with high ACEs were also less likely to
have a medical home [OR 0.66, 95% CI (0.57, 0.76)]. High ACEs were also significantly associated with greater difficulty
accessing mental health treatment [OR 0.55, 95% CI (0.43, 0.70)]. Similar results were found for children in the moderate
ACE (2–3) and low ACE (1) groups.
*Conclusions* *for* *Practice* Findings indicate that greater ACEs were associated with poorer quality medical care and greater
difficulty accessing needed mental health treatment. Because findings indicate that children with high ACEs may be the least
likely to receive quality care or necessary mental health treatment to address this adversity, universal screening for ACEs
should be considered with caution.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Results based on nationally
representative data indicate that children exposed to high
adverse childhood experiences have reduced odds of receiving
quality provider care and having no difficulty accessing
needed mental health treatment to address adversity.
